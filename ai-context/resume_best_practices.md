| Volume | "Processed 500+ applications weekly" |
| Time | "Decreased onboarding time from 2 weeks to 3 days" |

## Keyword Strategy

### Extracting Keywords from Job Descriptions

2. **Soft Skills** — Behavioral qualities requested
3. **Tools/Technologies** — Specific software/platforms
4. **Certifications** — Required/preferred credentials
5. **Industry Terms** — Domain-specific language

### Keyword Integration (Natural)

```
❌ Keyword stuffing:
"Project management professional with project management 
experience in project management roles..."

✅ Natural integration:
"PMP-certified project manager with 8 years of experience 
leading cross-functional teams through Agile and Waterfall 
methodologies, delivering projects up to $5M on time and 
under budget"
```
